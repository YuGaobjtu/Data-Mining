'''
TASK 1
First, implement the reservoir sampling or the Flajolet-Martin algorithm used in the graph algorithm 
presented in the paper you have selected;

TASK 2
Second, implement the streaming graph algorithm presented in the paper that uses the algorithm
implemented in the first step.Â 

--> It makes more sense for us to implement the Algo in one implementation.
