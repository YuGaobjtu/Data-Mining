About this repository:
This repository was created for lab1 of the Data Mining course at KTH in the fall semester 2022

Authors:
Yu Guo
Niklas Barth

HOW TO LAUNCH THE CODE:

- 1) conntect your data TODO @GUO please describe how you to do that
- 2) run the main file

DATA:
- @Guo please briefly say 1-2 sentences about the data and perhaps why you picked it

CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT THE CODE:

- Shinglets: We decided to use words instead of chars to speed up computation on our machines
- MinHashing: We used the iteration index in the foor loop to have consistency for every step in n when applying the generic hashfunction h(x) = (a + b*x) % p

RESULT:
- We computed the similarity based on the jaccard similarity as well as the comparing the signatures. See the following screenshot to see the results of our used test data set:
- TODO @GUO please run the main after you set the data and take a screenshot of the console
